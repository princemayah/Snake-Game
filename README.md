## Introduction

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using the Pygame library. Players control a snake, guiding it to eat food while avoiding collisions with the snake's own body and the screen edges.

## Features

- Snake movement using arrow keys.
- Randomly generated food for the snake to eat.
- Keeps track of the player's score and high score.
- Timer to track the duration of each game.
- Displays a leaderboard with the top ten scores and their playtime.
- Gameover screen with options to play again or quit.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.
- The snake cannot move backward. For example, if the snake is moving to the right, you cannot immediately make it move to the left, and vice versa.
- Eat the randomly appearing food to increase your snake's length and score.
- Avoid collisions with the snake's own body and the screen edges.

## Controls

- Arrow Up: Move the snake upward.
- Arrow Down: Move the snake downward.
- Arrow Left: Move the snake to the left.
- Arrow Right: Move the snake to the right.
- Q: Quit the game (on the game over screen).
- C: Play again (on the game over screen).

## Leaderboard

The game keeps track of high scores and displays a leaderboard with the top ten scores and their playtime.
